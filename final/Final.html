			<h1> Syracuse Housing Vacancies - An Examination </h1>
			<h2> Vacancy levels vary by neighborhood, but one stands out from the rest. Here, I take a look into the data, establish key findings, discuss causes and effects, and suggest next steps moving forward based on the facts and figures.</h2>

			<h3>The Data - Visualized</h3>
			
			<iframe title="Syracuse Housing Vacancy Rates by Neighborhood" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Z4LXS" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Z4LXS/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="455" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>

			<p>This dataset examines a total of 1,651 properties from around the Syracuse area. Despite this variety, there is a stark divide in rates between commercial and residential properties, with 1,489 residentials being listed as vacant and only 162 vacancies for commercial properties. To elaborate, a strong portion of vacancies reside in the Brighton neighborhood, over 60 more than any other neighborhood's tally. As a neighboring area to the University neighborhood just on the other side of I-81, Brighton has relatively appealing affordability, contradicting its vacancy issues. What more reasonably explains the vacancy matter is Brighton's status as a low-income area, one of the most severe in the United States. According to Neighborhood Scout, Brighton has an average income lower than 92.3% of neighborhoods in the entire country, with over 37% of children below the federal poverty line, giving it a poverty rate higher than 87.6% of American neighborhoods. The median price for real estate listings in Brighton is just under $132,000, making it cheaper than in 94.8% of New York neighborhoods and 91.3% of neighborhoods nationwide. With a vacancy rate of 20%, Brighton is in the 87th percentile of this statistic across the United States.</p>

			<h3>Other areas in comparison</h3>
			<p>It is worth examining the other neighborhoods under evaluation to understand the causes behind such differences in vacancy rates. The Northside, Westside, Southside, and Southwest neighborhoods follow Brighton as the areas with highest vacancy rates, with most due to similar causes previously noted in Brighton's case. Another notable detail is the much smaller gaps between each of these neighborhoods compared to that with Brighton, where the second and fifth-highest vacant neighborhoods seeing a gap only slightly bigger than that between first and second. These discrepancies are not common considering a city which has been struggling with its status of high poverty rates as of late, but the differences seen underline significant areas of improvement needed in the Brighton neighborhood, where home vacancies have grown to be more of a predictable constant than an alarming standout. Also worth noting is that this data examination pays exclusive attention to the neighborhoods with rather high vacancy rates, as opposed to the more affluent and occupied areas of Syracuse. These findings are not meant to label Syracuse as an empty or impoverished city, rather to give attention and focus to the areas that need the most help and support due to the reasons outlined.</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Overall, based on the causes evaluated throughout, there is no one single reason to indicate the causes of abnormally high vacancy levels across Syracuse neighborhoods. However, steps can still be taken to help ensure that homes are filled with deserving residents. Affordabiliy should remain a priority, while more attention could be given to homelessness statistics in the same areas. That data paired with what we have in regards to vacancies would be able to help match housing opportunities to those who need them most, helping solve both issues of homelessness and property vacancies at once.</p>
